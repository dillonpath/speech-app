# Demo Script - Social X-Ray

## Setup (Before Demo)

- [ ] Two phones with app installed
- [ ] Screen mirroring ready for projector
- [ ] Demo conversation script prepared
- [ ] Backup video ready in case of technical issues
- [ ] Haptic feedback tested and working

## 5-Minute Demo Flow

### 1. Hook (30 seconds)

**Script:**
> "Raise your hand if you've ever left a conversation wondering: 'Did I talk too much?' or 'Did I sound nervous?'"
>
> "We've all bombed interviews, tanked dates, or killed conversations without knowing why. Social X-Ray changes that by turning social anxiety into actionable data."

### 2. Live Demo Part 1 - Before Coaching (2 minutes)

**Setup:**
- Two presenters on stage
- Person A wears the app (projected on screen)
- Person B has normal conversation

**Mock Interview Scenario:**
```
Interviewer (B): "Tell me about your experience with AI."

Candidate (A): [Interrupts] "Oh, I love AI! I've worked on like, um,
several projects and, you know, it's really fascinating how, um,
like machine learning works and..." [continues for 90 seconds]
```

**Show on Screen:**
- Real-time metrics updating
- Speaking % bar: 85% vs 15%
- Interruption counter: 3
- WPM graph spiking to 200+
- Phone vibrating (haptic feedback)

**Pause and Point Out:**
> "Look - John just interrupted Sarah for the 3rd time. His speaking pace jumped from 140 to 210 words per minute. The app just buzzed him to slow down."

### 3. Live Demo Part 2 - With Coaching (1 minute)

**Restart conversation with feedback:**
```
Interviewer (B): "What's your biggest strength?"

Candidate (A): [Waits for complete question, pauses] "I'd say
problem-solving. Can you tell me more about the challenges
your team is facing?" [More balanced]
```

**Show on Screen:**
- Speaking %: 50% vs 50%
- Interruptions: 0
- Questions asked: 2
- Pace: 150 WPM (green/good)

> "Watch the difference - 50/50 split, no interruptions, asking questions. This is what improvement looks like in real-time."

### 4. Dashboard Reveal (1 minute)

**Pull up analytics screen:**

**Show:**
- Report card: B+ â†’ A-
- Time distribution pie chart
- Interruption heatmap
- Key insights:
  - "You interrupted 3 times in first conversation, 0 in second"
  - "Your pace dropped from 210 to 150 WPM"
  - "You asked 0 questions first time, 2 questions second time"

> "The app doesn't just track - it teaches. Sarah, you asked 8 questions. John, you asked 2. Next time, be more curious."

### 5. Use Cases (30 seconds)

**Quick fire use cases:**
- Job interviews - know if you talked too much
- First dates - reduce awkward silences
- Sales calls - optimize your pitch
- Therapy sessions - track communication progress
- Social anxiety - measure real improvement

### 6. Tech Stack (30 seconds)

> "Built with cutting-edge tech:"
- Gemini API for real-time speech analysis
- Cloudflare Workers for low-latency processing
- ElevenLabs for voice feedback
- React Native for cross-platform

### 7. The Closer (30 seconds)

> "Social X-Ray makes soft skills measurable, trackable, and improvable. It's like having a conversation coach in your pocket."
>
> "Because you can't improve what you can't measure. Now you can."

## Backup Plan

If live demo fails:
1. Switch to pre-recorded video
2. Show static dashboard screenshots
3. Focus on insights and value proposition

## Q&A Prep

**Expected Questions:**

Q: "How accurate is the speaker detection?"
A: "Gemini's speaker diarization is 90%+ accurate. We also have a simplified mode that tracks only your metrics."

Q: "Privacy concerns with recording conversations?"
A: "All processing is local. Audio is deleted after analysis. Clear consent screen on launch."

Q: "How does this compare to Gong/Chorus?"
A: "Those are for sales teams and cost $100+/month. We're for individuals at $9.99/month."

Q: "Battery impact?"
A: "We process in 5-second chunks, not continuous. Low-power mode available for 3+ hour battery life."
